This tool was created as my final project for Undergraduate Seminar in Data Visualization during Fall 2013 at RIT.

I created this project as a way of visualizing the Marvel Comics Power Grid by involving pictures and quotes from characters that are dynamically loaded from the Marvel Comics Database at http://marvel.wikia.com/.

All of the code on this project is mine with the exception of the jQuery library (located in the js directory) and the PowerTip plugin for jQuery (located in the src and css directories).
